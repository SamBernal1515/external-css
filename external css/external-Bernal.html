<h2>The Evolution of Anxiety: Why We Worry and What to Do About It
</h2>
<p>
Let’s pretend for a moment that you are a giraffe. You live on the
grasslands of the African savanna. You have a neck that is 7 feet long (2.1 meters).
Every now and then, you spot a group of humans driving around on a safari taking
pictures of you.
But it’s not just your neck and their cameras that separates you
from the humans. Perhaps the biggest difference between you and your giraffe friends
and the humans taking your picture is that nearly every decision you make provides
an immediate benefit to your life.
When you are hungry, you walk over and munch on a tree.
When a storm rolls across the plains, you take shelter under the
brush.
When you spot a lion stalking you and your friends, you run away.
On any given day, most of your choices as a giraffe—like what to eat
or where to sleep or when to avoid a predator—make an immediate impact on your
life.You are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You live in

what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly
deliver clear and immediate outcomes.

<h2>The Evolution of the Human Brain</h2>
<p>
The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return
environment.
The earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens
sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first
humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the
newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like
language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are
walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.
Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is incredibly new.
It is only recently—during the last 500 years or so—that our society has shifted to
a predominantly Delayed Return Environment. The pace of change has increased
exponentially compared to prehistoric times. In the last 100 years we have seen the
rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the Internet,
and Beyonce. Nearly everything that makes up your daily life has been created in a
very small window of time.
A lot can happen in 100 years. From the perspective of evolution,
however, 100 years is nothing. The modern human brain spent hundreds of thousands of
years evolving for one type of environment (immediate returns) and in the blink of
an eye the entire environment changed (delayed returns). Your brain was designed to
value immediate returns.

brain reached modern proportions around three hundred thousand years ago. Evolution
never stops, of course, and the shape of the structure appears to have continued to
evolve in meaningful ways until it reached both modern size and shape sometime
between one hundred thousand and thirty-five thousand years ago. Simon Neubauer,
